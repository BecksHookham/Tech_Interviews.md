## Giving Feedback

The magic of this session is experiential. You'll grow just by listening and feeling yourself answering questions and by listening to others do the same.

But we're still going to give constructive and compassionate feedback to each other during this session.

If, however, on this particular day you'd prefer not to receive feedback then please tell your group you'd like to opt out. Embrace your boundaries.

If you're giving and receiving feedback it should go something like this:

### Interviewee Checks in with the group.

After your 10 minute interview, you (the interviewer) should check in quickly with the group and share how the experience was for you. You might decide at the end that you don't want feedback and so you have an opportunity here to let the group know how you are.

### Observer shares 1 - 3 constructive notes

Then the observer can share their feedback. Don't critique every question asked line by line (this will take too long and your interviewee is unlikely to remember what you said).

Instead, try to sum up your thoughts about the interview in two or three constructive "notes".

At least one note should comment on a positive behaviour you thought was effective.
Then give one or two two notes of contructive criticim. Be specific and back up your point with an example.

When you're in your role as observer it might be helpful to think about the following things:

* Did the interviewee go straight into answering the questions without taking a breath to think?
* Are they making appropriate eye contact?
* Were the answers clear and concise or did you have trouble comprehending the final point?
* Did you find yourself losing concentration while you listened to the answers (which might suggest waffling)
* Was the interviewee comfortable responding "I don't know, but..." when they weren't quite sure of the answer?
* How was the interviewee's tone of voice? 
* Did you hear points backed up with specific examples?
* Are you confident that the interviewee is someone that would enjoy a career in coding?

### Interviewer shares one or two notes if they have them.

You might reinforce what the observer has shared or add one or two constructive thoughts of your own.
