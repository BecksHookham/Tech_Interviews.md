quality engineering / testing interview questions
==================================

### BEHAVIOURAL


1. Tell me about your decision to become a software developer.
2. Can you describe a time when you had to learn a new tool or technology quickly to complete a project? How did you approach the learning process?
3. Tell me about a situation where you identified a major bug or issue in the software. How did you handle it and what steps did you take to ensure it was resolved effectively?
4. Describe a time when you had to collaborate with developers to improve the quality of the code. How did you approach the collaboration and what was the outcome?
5. How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure when ensuring the quality of a product? Can you give an example from your experience?
6. Can you provide an example of a time when you had to deal with conflicting priorities in your testing tasks? How did you manage your time and resources to address them?

### TECHNICAL

1. What steps do you take when you encounter a failing test case in your automation suite?
2. How do you use logs to identify the root cause of a test failure? Can you give an example?

4. How do you approach debugging a script that is not executing as expected?
5. What tools do you use for debugging your automation scripts? How do these tools help you?
6. Explain how you would debug a situation where your automated tests are passing locally but failing on a CI server.
7. Describe a time when you had to debug a complex issue in your automation tests. What was the problem and how did you solve it?
8. How do you differentiate between an issue with the test script and an issue with the application under test?
9. What techniques do you use to isolate the cause of a failure in a large and complex test suite?
10. How do you ensure that your automated tests provide meaningful feedback for debugging purposes?
11.What is the difference between black-box testing and white-box testing, and when would you use each type?
12. How do you design a test automation framework from scratch? Can you explain the key components and their roles?
13. Explain the concept of continuous integration and continuous testing. How do they contribute to the development lifecycle?
14. How would you approach testing an API? What tools and strategies would you use to ensure comprehensive coverage?
15. Describe how you would implement performance testing for a web application. What tools would you use and what metrics would you measure?
16. What are the key differences between unit testing, integration testing, and system testing? Provide examples of each.
17. How do you handle flaky tests in your test automation suite? What strategies do you use to identify and fix them?
18. Explain the importance of test data management in automated testing. How do you ensure your tests have the right data?
19. What is code coverage, and how do you measure it? What level of code coverage do you consider adequate?
20. How do you integrate automated tests with a CI/CD pipeline? Can you describe the steps and tools involved?

### Selenium
1. What is Selenium, and what are its main components?
2. How do you locate elements on a web page using Selenium WebDriver? Can you give examples of different locators?
3. Can you describe how you would write a simple Selenium WebDriver script to navigate to a website and verify its title?
4. What is the purpose of the wait command in Selenium, and what are the differences between implicit and explicit waits?

### JUnit
1. What is JUnit, and how is it used in Java testing?
2. Can you explain the difference between @Before, @BeforeClass, @After, and @AfterClass annotations in JUnit?

### PyTest
1. What is PyTest, and how does it differ from the built-in unittest module in Python?
2. How do you create and run a simple test case using PyTest? Can you provide a code example?
3. What are fixtures in PyTest, and how are they used to manage setup and teardown code?

### CircleCI and Travis CI (CI/CD)
1. What is continuous integration, and why is it important in modern software development?
2. How would you set up a basic CI pipeline in CircleCI for a simple Python project?
3. Can you explain the basic structure of a .travis.yml file and how it is used in Travis CI to configure a build?
4.How do you integrate Selenium tests into a CircleCI pipeline? What steps are involved?
Describe how you would troubleshoot a failing build in Travis CI. What steps would you take to identify and resolve the issue?
