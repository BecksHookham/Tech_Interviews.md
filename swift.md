### SWIFT

- Can you tell us some of the pros and cons of developing in Swift today?
- What's your opinion on adopting Swift in both legacy projects and green-field projects?
- Can you give us a quick overview of the benefits of Swift over Objective-C? And on how they differ?
- The elevator-pitch question: I'm the CTO of a company thinking of switching from Obj-C to Swift. You have 30 seconds to convince me one way or the other.
- Say that there is a function for which we can define a reasonable default, but we need to define specialised versions for a couple of edge cases. How can we do this in Swift?
- Have you played with Swift Playgrounds? What are its key features and benefits?
- Are you familiar with the latest changes in the Swift language itself? If so, can you elaborate on some of them?
- When overriding an initialiser method in Obj-C, you generally call the super implementation before doing anything else. In Swift, the compiler will complain if you do that in certain situations. Do you know when and why?
- What's your opinion about `Protocol Oriented Programming` as opposed to the more traditional approach we've had on iOS?
- What are the differences between a `protocol` with a default implementation, and a `base class`?
- Is it possible to define an instance method that applies to arrays of integers but *not* to arrays of doubles, or any other type? Can you think of an example when this could be useful? Do you happen to know the syntax?
- What is the Swift embedded runtime?
- What is the difference between `value semantics` and `reference semantics`?
- So, say that you have a struct and one or more of its properties is of a reference type. What happens then? Is the struct still a value type?
- How do the Obj-C and Swift runtime environments manage memory these days?
- How does `ARC` work?
- Do you know what `autorelease pools` are? When are they useful?
- Do you know what retain cycles are? Can you give examples? Is it something to worry about and, if so, what facilities are available in Swift to handle them?
- Do you know what the `weak`, `strong`, and `unowned` keywords are, and when they need to be used?
- What are the differences between `copy`, `strong`, `weak` and `assign` property attributes? When should you use each of them?
- What is the difference between the Swift `nil` and the Obj-C `nil`?
- What storage options do you know for iOS and when should you use them?
- Why is it inherently harder to do static analysis in languages like obj-c compared to languages like swift?
- Do you know what `Protocol Extensions` are?
- What is the `mutating` keyword?
- What is the `@availability` attribute?
- What is the `@objc` keyword used for?
- Do you know what `@autoclosure` and `@escaping` attributes are and when to use them?
- Do you know what `type-erasure` is in the context of Swift generics?
- Why is it that, in swift, you can't have an array of, say, `Equatable`, ie, what's the reason for the compiler error "Protocol 'XXX' can only be used as a generic constraint because it has Self or associated type requirements"?
- Are you familiar with functional-programming methods such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`? Can you explain their similarities and differences?
- `Swift Standard Library`: What are `Generator`s, `Sequence`s and `Collection`s?
- What problems do optionals solve?
- Do you use optionals to handle state? If so, how do you model Errors in an Optional context?
