# What Kinds of Tech Tests Might I Encounter

## The Take Home Tech Test

The take home tech test might look something like this:
* [Just Eat Recruitment Test](https://github.com/justeat/JustEat.RecruitmentTest)
* (Rightmove Front-End)[https://github.com/rightmove/remote-front-end-test]
* (Sky)[https://github.com/skybet/tech-test}

When you receive a tech test, keep the following things in mind:

**Consider the Deadline**: 
* If you're given a deadline, keep to it. If you are likely to go over deadline, of course you can get in touch with the company and ask for an extension. Just be aware that might say yes but you'll probably be at a disadvantage compared to others who have completed earlier.

* If you're not given a deadline, it's a good idea to let them know when you'll complete the test and keep to your own deadline

**Use your ReadMe to explain your process**: 

Your ReadMe is an amazing tool to communicate with your employer and give them into insight into your workflow and coding processes. A great ReadMe might include a diagram, a walkthrough of how you approached the test and what you'd do differently if you had more time. 

Here's a nice example. This is a [React tech test](https://github.com/dani-boo/tech-test-vodafone) Maker Danielle did for Vodafone.

**Keep To the Brief**: 

You must complete the task you've been given. It's not unheard of for a Maker to find the actual task at hand a little challenging and instead add nice features they are more comfortable with. You can add some extra features to your tech test but you must complete the brief first or at least show that you've given it a good go.

**Ask Clarifying questions before you begin**: 

* This will include whether they expect you to use TDD.
* If it's a Makers hiring partner, they probably want to see TDD bit it's still a good idea to clarify.
* You can get in touch with your contact at the company if you get blocked during the tech test with the code you're writing or if you're not sure what features to include. Usually tech teams appreciate this as a sign of strong communication skills.

**If you're given a timed tech test, you'll almost always need more time**: 

* This applied to tech tests that come with the instructions "this should take you about two hours to complete"
* No, you are a Maker. You are great at figuring stuff out but not yet so great at remembering everything from the top of your head. You will need more than two hours.
* The way to appproach this is to spend some time working out how you would approach the tech test and figuring out how to implement features that are new to you. Only then should you start timing yourself to complete the tech test within the required window.

**The real function of a tech test is to have a discussion at interview**: 

I've seen Makers successfully get hired who had not completed their tech test. At the same time, I've seen employers really excited to interview a Maker after seeing an excellent tech test only to be disappointed when the Maker could not explain their code.

You can expect to be asked these kinds of questions:  


* Can you briefly explain the problem statement and your understanding of the requirements for this tech test?
* What approach did you take to solve the problem? Can you walk me through your thought process and the steps you took?
* How did you structure your code? Can you explain the organization of your code and why you chose this structure?
* Algorithms and Data Structures:
* What algorithms and data structures did you use in your solution, and why did you choose them?
*What challenges or obstacles did you encounter while working on the tech test, and how did you overcome them?
* Can you discuss the time and space complexity of your solution? How efficient do you think your solution is?
* How did you test your code to ensure it works correctly? Can you show me any unit tests or other testing methods you used?
* How did you handle potential errors or edge cases in your code? Can you give an example of an edge case you considered?
* How do you ensure that your code is readable and maintainable? Can you point out any comments or documentation you included?
* Looking back at your solution, is there anything you would do differently or any improvements you would make? Why?

The interviewer might also ask very specific questions about the code you've written like:

* In App.js, there is a function fetchData making an API call. Can you walk me through this function and explain how you handle the API response?
* You created a Button.js component. Can you explain how this component is designed to be reusable and show an example of it being used in your application?
* How does App.js communicate with its child components? Can you provide an example of passing data or functions between components and explain the rationale?

_These questions are designed to dig deeper into Danielle's Vodafone tech test above._
